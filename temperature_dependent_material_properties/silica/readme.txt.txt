Additional note(s):

- Density, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are given as constant in the whole temperature range 0 K - 320 K.

- In the specific heat capacity file, the 3rd column contains the data as copied from source [cal K^-1 g^-1];
	the 2nd column contains the data converted in SI units [J K^-1 kg^-1] and is the one that should be used.	
	2nd column = 3rd column * 4184

Crystallographic Reference Frame vs Material Reference Frame:

- No need to specify, since this material is in isotropic state.
