- For Poisson poly:
	element = Si; Poisson's ratio (unitless); solid; polycrystalline; temperature increment = 1 K

- For Poisson directional 001:
	element = Si; Poisson's ratio (unitless); solid; <100> axis; temperature increment = 1 K

Additional note(s):

- The temperature dependence of the directional properties might be more accurate than that of the full elastic matrix, but they are available only for a few selected directions.
	If the crystal is oriented along one of those directions, it mught be advantageous to load the directional properties instead of the full matrix.

Crystallographic Reference Frame vs Material Reference Frame:

- Crystallographic space group = Fd3m [227]; crystal system = cubic.

- The two frames coincide in orientation (but the Material Reference Frame is normalised: modulus of the basis vectors = 1)
